MISSION

I am trying a differant approach to create a website this time, because this ain't just a website, it is forging my Idea into a reality using web designing. I believe that art, or widely-speaking, a person's personality isn't limited to just photos and videos, so why should social networking sites only get restricted to photos and videos. pnv (photos and videos) aren't for everyone. I myself don't like clicking my pictures, as a result, I'm not much active on fb or insta. It means I don't actually have an e-social life. On this sites, a person with great looks has more followers than a person having a great talent. That has happened with me, and I'm sure it happens to many others too. So I want to change it.
